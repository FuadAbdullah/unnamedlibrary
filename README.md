# unnamed Library Management System

## How was it developed?
> The library management system was developed fully using Java programming language in Netbeans IDE with Java SE 8. 

## Why was it developed?
> The system was developed to fulfil the criteria of Java module assignment in the university course. 

## General description of the system
Overall, the system is functional and relies primarily on text files to store information related to the library including librarian, client and book information. Main features of the management system includes borrowing, returning, renewing of books, registration of client, book and librarian information as well as viewing borrowing records as history. As the system is meant for librarians to use, only they are capable of login. 

## Conclusion
All in all, the assignment assisted me in programming a functional system that integrates the basis of Java Object-Oriented concepts. Although I am still new to this, I am hoping that through my effort and time put into this particular development allow me to grow and mature as a Java programmer that can be benchmarked in future projects and developments.
